# Fullout Software - Age calculator

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, you need a decent understanding of HTML, Tailwind and a little JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this age calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin` (so just give it your best guess for this project).

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

The fonts for this project are already imported from Google Fonts. You can access them with `font-family: "Poppins"`.

## Starting the development server

We've included a few helpful packages to begin the project. The first step is to install the packages on your machine, by running `npm install`.

Next, you can start the development server. In a terminal window, run `npm run dev`. This process should open a new window in your browser automatically, or you can copy/paste this url into a browser: `http://localhost:3000`.

Finally, you will need to start the TailwindCSS compiler. To do this, open another terminal window and enter `npm run tailwind`. This will automatically update your TailwindCSS when you save any code updates.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the styles either using Tailwind classes, or in `input.css`.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions, but hosting is not required.

## Submitting your solution

Once completed, please send a link to either your GitHub, or you can send back a zip of all of the completed files. Best of luck, and please feel free to ask questions along the way if you get stuck!
